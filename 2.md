# Git: beyond the basics

## What is Git?

- Distributed version control software
- Created by Linux Torvalds in 2005 for use in Linux Kernel development
- Git is not GitHub

## Why use version control?

- Track and share histories of changes in a project
- Document progress and issues through the history of code changes
- Communicate with others about software changes
- Pinpoint when bugs were first introduced and later resolved
- Write better code more deliberately

## Why use Git?

- Distributed, redundant, efficient
- Operates locally
- Works with any project, large and small
- Small footprint
- Fast
- Nearly ubiquitous in modern software development
