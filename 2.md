# Git: beyond the basics

## Who this talk is for

This talk is for someone who:
- has basic unix command line skills: `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `echo` (bonus points
  for `less` and `vim`).
- has had the usual crash course in `git`: `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`.
- only has used git because they had to.
- is slow to commit.
- has merge anxiety.
- writes commit messages like this: "more work", "oopsie", "additional changes", ".".
