# Git: beyond the basics

## When you first learned git

Remember your first programming class where you had to use git to turn your
work?

- You set it up the first day of class and only really had to memorize
  commiting and pushing.
- You used it after you were done with an assignment, not as a part of your
  workflow.
- You were taught how, but probably not why.


### What you probably already know

You vaguely remember,
- `git clone`
- `git init` and `git remote add`

You know,
- `git add` and `git commit`, or the potentially sinful `git commit -am`
- `git push`

and maybe you've seen or heard tell of,
- `git log`
- `git checkout`
- `git branch`
- `git merge`
- `git rebase`
