# Git: beyond the basics

## Who this talk is for

- very basic unix command line skills: `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `echo` (bonus points
  for `less` and `vim`)
- had the usual crash course in git: `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`
- use git because you have to
- slow to commit
- merge anxiety

## What you probably already know

Remember your first programming class? Remember turning in your first
programming assignment? Were you forced to turn in your assignments with git?
Did your commits look like this?



`git init` and `git remote add` or `git clone`

`git add` and `git commit`
`git push`

and maybe

`git log`
`git branch`
`git merge`
`git rebase`
