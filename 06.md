# Git: beyond the basics

## Basic Concepts

### Git Takes Snapshots

Git stores snapshots of a mini filesystem. When you make a commit, you are
instructing git to take a snapshot of the files added to that commit.

Git uses diffs to efficiently store additional snapshots of the same file.

Git attaches metadata to each commit, such as a commit message, the author and
a timestamp.

### Git repository

The set of all saved commits that can be checked out into the working
directory.

### Working directory

The directory containing `.git` and any files therein that have been checked
into git are part of the Working Tree.

Changes that you make to files here are not committed unless they are first
staged using `git add`.

### HEAD

The current commit that is checked out into the working directory.

Tip: `HEAD^` is shorthand for "the commit before `HEAD`".

### Staging area

The set of changes *to be* committed. The staging area allows you to break
large modifications into separate commits.
