# Git: beyond the basics

## Rebasing

- Re-apply a series of commits to a different initial parent commit.
- Alters the commit history since all parent commits and timestamps will be
  altered.
- Results in a cleaner commit history with fewer merge commits.
- Can still result in conflicts just like merging.

### When to rebase?
- You are the only person working on the branch.
- You want to eventually be able to do a fast-forward merge of this branch back
  into another branch.


From `man git-rebase`
```
Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "topic":

             A---B---C topic
            /
       D---E---F---G master

From this point, the result of either of the following commands:

   git rebase master
   git rebase master topic

would be:

                     A'--B'--C' topic
                    /
       D---E---F---G master
```
